During my undergraduate at CUNY Hunter College I wrote a thesis about 'The Effects of Math Anxiety on The Identification of Financial Terminology.' I worked on this research for over a year and a half. I also presented my findings at The Eastern Psychological Associations Spring 2019 confrence. This page includes information about my findings as well as a copy of my thesis.

Those who suffer from math anxiety may have trouble answering math questions or managing their personal finances. One hundred fifty-two undergraduate students (58.6% females) participated in our study. The participants completed a series of lab-based tasks that included defining financial terminology, solving math equations, and a math anxiety inventory. We examined the relationship between overall math anxiety, the subscales of math anxiety (anxiety towards math tests, math courses, and numeracy), math ability, andthe ability to identify financial terms. While we did not find a correlation between math anxiety and the ability to identify financial terms in the overall population, we found a non-robust negative correlation in looking at just the female population. We also found negative correlations within the subscales of math anxiety and the ability to define financial terms. In addition, we also found a moderate positive correlation between math ability and financial literacy.
