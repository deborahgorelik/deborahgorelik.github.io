My name is Deborah Gorelik and I am an aspiring UX Researcher. I have always been interested in human behavior and the way that individuals interact with one another. As a psychology major, I was able to explore this interest through developmental, cognitive, and neurological perspectives.</p>

<p>
I am currently a pursuing a Master of Science in Information Experience Design at The Pratt Institute. Upon completion of the program, I hope to conduct research on how people in more sensitive populations interact with certain applications. It would be my dream to contribute to making online spaces more pleasant and fruitful for all. </p>

<p>
I have recently started a position as a UX Participant Recruiter. In my role, I screen and schedule participants for UX Researchers. I have been in this role for almost a month and I am looking forward to learning and growing in this position for the course of the contract. </p>
<p>
Here is a brief list of goals on the job:
<ol type="1">
  <li>Become familiar with different UX Research projects.</li>
  <ul>
      <li>I will be able to do this through speaking with Researchers in our syncs.</li>
      <li>I can also speak to researchers about projects they are working on.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Improve at multi-tasking several studies at once.</li>
  <ul>
      <li>I will be handling up to six studies at a time. All studies will be at different stages in the process - with some just beginning and others in the concluding phase.</li>
      <li>I will take measures to stay organized throughout all phases in the study.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Begin to understand the tools I need in order to become a succesful UX Researcher in the future. </li>
  <ul>
      <li>I will be able to do this by speaking with UX researchers about their backgrounds.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
